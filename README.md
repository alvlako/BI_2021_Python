## That is the exercises on classes in Python.

In the 1st exercise, the class representing Phage was constructed. 
The objects of this class are capable of:
> executing the type (DNA/RNA or PhageError if no normal nucleotides are presented)
> invading the bacteria (the success of invasion defined by the presence of spacers in the phage genome which are equal to CRISPR spacers database in bacterial cassette)
> going lytic (with the eliminating of spacers set in bacteria)

In the 2nd exercise, the class representing RNA was constructed. 
The objects of this class are capable of:
> translation (RNA -> protein, with an option to check for the presence of start codon and starting translating with that)
> reverse transcription (RNA -> DNA)

In the 3rd exercise, the class representing set containing no negative values was constructed. This NonNegativeSet also does not allow user to add negative values with the add() method.

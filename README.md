## Here is the script for iterators homework

The script contains first and second tasks solutions. 
Simply run script with python3. 

The script does not only make the first iterator, but also shows how it works. For that the script will ask you for the path to the example fasta file. This example will also be used for the second generator to show how it performs.

Do not forget that the second generator iterates for unlimited time. So the script will ask you after showing the first script work, whether you would like to proceed. If you say yes, it will provide you with unlimited amount of evolving sequences. Otherwise, it will raise KeyboardInterrupt and stop the script.
